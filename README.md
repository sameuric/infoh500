# INFO-H-500 Oral exam (Labs part)
The present labs exercises have been completed for the oral exam (labs part) of the course INFO-H-500 in 2022.

Keywords: watermark, numpy, skimage.io, matplotlib, dithering and noise reduction, watershed

### Objectives

*After following this course, one shouldbe able to understand different kind of images, to analyse and decompose an image recognition problem into some basic steps, to propose features to extract from the raw data for a given problem, to implement an image processing chain using generic tools and specialized libraries. In parallel to the lectures, a serie of labs are is organized. The student are invited to reuse lecture material given as Jupyter Python Notebooks during the laboratory.*

## Structure

This repo is composed of three exercises, each of them in their corresponding Python source file.

1. **Watermark**  
   Write code to automatically add a watermark to a photograph.

2. **Picture enhancement**  
   Write code that automatically enhances a photograph. "Enhance" may mean a lot of different things, and we encourage you to be creative in which enhancements you want to implement.

3. **Tumour segmentation**  
   The image below is a slice of a brain MRI with a large tumour in it. The goal of this exercise is to create an algorithm to automatically segment the tumour.
